# **A Genetic Risk Assessment Site for Lung Cancer**

## **Introduction**

Lung cancer is a malignant lung tumor causing 1,370,000 death every year. The two main types of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) , the  proportion of  NSCLC accounts for 80% of lung cancer, and the proportion of SCLC is about 20% of lung cancer. Most lung cancer patients are due to long-term smoking or inhalation of radon, asbestos and second-hand smoke, but some of the patients with lung cancer are due to genetic factors. To clarify the role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, a cohort study was conducted to identify related loci and screen susceptibility loci. Based on the 1000 genome project and a large number of literature reports, we integrate the susceptibility loci of lung cancer into a database. We have created a genetic risk assessment site for lung cancer Using this database, which is used to quickly and conveniently assess the genetic risk of lung cancer. We hope to provide efficient and convenient services for scientific research and clinical workers in this field.
